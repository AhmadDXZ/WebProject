      <p>
        This project was built as part of the Web Applications Programming and Engineering course.
        The goal was to create a component-based front-end app using React.js that demonstrates key
        modern web development skills such as state management, routing, form handling, and responsive design.
      </p>
      <p>
        It features a mock bookstore with filtering and sorting, placeholder login and registration forms,
        and a responsive layout that works on all devices.
      </p>

        Developed by: <strong>Team CodeCrafters</strong><br />
